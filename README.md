## Overview

This README documents the upcoming LMP Seminar titled *“Pattern Formation by Turbulent Cascades”*, which will be delivered by Dr. Michel Fruchart at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.

The seminar will explore how fully developed turbulence — typically considered chaotic and structureless — can be harnessed to generate structured patterns through nonlinear physical mechanisms.

---

## Abstract Summary

Fully developed turbulence is a universal, scale-invariant chaotic state characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales, where dissipation eventually occurs.

In this seminar, a novel mechanism will be presented in which:

* Turbulent cascades are **non-dissipatively arrested**
* Energy accumulates at an intermediate scale
* A specific wavelength emerges
* Structured patterns form through a fully nonlinear process

Unlike classical pattern formation driven by linear instabilities of homogeneous states, this mechanism operates entirely through nonlinear cascade dynamics.

## Key Scientific Focus

### 1. Energy Cascade and Scale Selection

Energy typically flows from large to small scales in turbulence. However, when the cascade is arrested without dissipation, energy can pile up at an intermediate scale, leading to spontaneous wavelength selection.

---

### 2. Odd Viscosity

A central concept of the seminar is **odd viscosity**, a non-dissipative transport coefficient found in chiral fluids.

Odd viscosity:

* Acts like a scale-dependent Coriolis force
* Induces two-dimensionalization of flow at small scales
* Enables tunable pattern wavelengths
* Appears in systems ranging from bioactive matter to quantum fluids

This differs from rotating fluids, where two-dimensionalization typically occurs at large scales.

---

### 3. Potential Applications

The cascade-induced pattern formation mechanism may be relevant to:

* Atmospheric flows
* Stellar plasma (e.g., solar wind)
* Mass cascades in particulate systems
* Pulverization and coagulation processes
